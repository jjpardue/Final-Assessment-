# Final-Assessment



## My role & Contributions 

My role was "X" which was to oversee the technologies used. However, I do have to say that was a team effort. I believe that while I feel like I know a little about a lot and there is an opportunity to go deeper within various interfaces, I can say I pulled on my experience in leadership and strategy to make sure we  were all organized and on the same page. 

Areas of interest for me in this project were more in the UX design of the site. I was able to partner more with Charlie Ito on this and his experience from working with the IT department at the City of Minneapolis. I learned a lot from Charlie, as well! 

## Team Assessment:

We worked well together. I think we all had different strengths, equally respected and used. I was surprised at how fast the time went by in class and on this last project. I think there is an opportunity to go deeper with technology as well, it was interesting to pose hypotheses on a dataset that we were not familiar with. Had we knowns the history and true differences between natural and lab-grown diamonds, I am not sure we would have posed the questions we did at the beginning. However, to that point, that's part of the process. 

## Summary of Project:

Our project goal was to see if a logistic regression, machine learning, model could predict whether a diamond with certain characteristics was natural or lab-grown. We also wanted to find out which characteristic(s) of a diamond makes it valuable.

Part of our project was to scrape and clean the data and use subsequent logistic regression to determine the origin of the diamond: natural or lab-grown.

Working remotely as a team of four, we assigned roles to each team member and dug into the front and backend of our predictive website to create a user-friendly and esthetically pleasing site which would be both educational and interactive.

Users of the site are able to input diamond attributes of their choice and our model will deliver the result of their diamond based on user input.

A logistic regression model was used to predict the diamond type. This model allows us to predict binary outcomes, meaning that there are only two possible results.

The features we used for the model were shape, cut, color, clarity, carat, price, and report. Our target was the diamond's type, either natural or lab-grown. After running the logistic model, an accuracy score of 0.98 was achieved.
